                A year ago, I almost didn't make it. Today, I live differently.
              </p>
              <p>
                It has been 365 days since it happened, a full year that feels both distant and impossibly like yesterday. 
                In that time, I've begun a new life, one built on presence rather than plans. The idea of a grand, 
                long-term goal still sounds nice in theory, but after what I've lived through, I find peace in the now.
              </p>

              <h3>the act</h3>
              <p>
                November 9, 2024. A Saturday afternoon in Miami, around 4 p.m., at South Pointe Beach. I was with two 
                friends, S and P. I had actually just met P that day. The three of us were out in the water, laughing, 
                floating, and riding waves.
              </p>
              <p>
                After about forty-five minutes, S stepped out of the water. It was just me and P. Then, out of nowhere, 
                a big wave hit. I lost my footing on the ocean bed. Before I could recover, a second wave came in harder 
                and pulled me in. That's when panic took over. I tried swimming back, but every stroke seemed useless. 
                The more I tried, the further I felt from control. In that chaos, my mind started to process what my body 
                already knew <em>I was in trouble</em>. P was next to me, and somehow, he stayed calm. He tried to help 
                me steady myself, to keep me level with the water. I grabbed onto him, and in that instant, my life 
                literally depended on him. When I looked back at the shore, it was far way farther than it should have 
                been. That's when real fear hit. It's a terrible feeling, realizing that your survival comes down to 
                whether you can keep trying for one more second. If I stopped swimming, if I stopped breathing, that 
                would be it.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was a brief moment when everything went quiet inside my head. I remember thinking, <em>this could 
                be it.</em> That single thought has stayed with me every day since.
              </p>
              <p>
                Luckily, the lifeguard had seen us by then. He reached us, pulled us in, and before I knew it, we were 
                back on the sand. Alive. The first thing we did? We laughed. For two straight minutes, we just laughed, 
                shaking from adrenaline and disbelief. All I could say was, "What the fuck just happened?"
              </p>

              <h3>initial emotions</h3>
              <p>
                Originally, I wasn't even planning to go to the beach that afternoon. The plan was to head there later 
                in the evening. I wasn't supposed to meet S and P there either. The lifeguard could have seen us a few 
                moments later. I could have given up. Ifs, buts, and variables, this story could have ended very 
                differently, maybe even been told by someone else.
              </p>
              <p>
                After all the chaos, I sat on a bench watching the sunset. We got ourselves popsicles, I picked peach 
                orange. I remember calling my friend R right after and telling him what happened. He laughed at first, 
                then reminded me why he always says "be safe" instead of "have a good time" whenever I travel. Later that 
                night, I called my friends back in India and poured my heart out. The next day, I gathered the courage to 
                tell the story to the friend who's unofficially my mom. Of course, I got schooled. I deserved it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything around me felt sharper, slower, heavier. Every small thing around me carried new weight. 
                Gratitude wasn't just an idea anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                I never planned to tell my parents. My mom has already seen two of her brothers pass away at a young age, 
                and I don't think I could ever make her relive that kind of fear. They don't follow me on X, and 
                thankfully, I haven't been stupid in the last year.
              </p>

              <h3>big moves</h3>
              <p>
                My people. My work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The week that followed was unexpectedly eventful. I received an Outstanding Paper Award, and S won Best 
                Paper at the same conference. From there, I went straight home for a close family wedding. My emotions 
                were still running high from everything that had happened the week before, and suddenly I was surrounded 
                by the people I love most. It felt grounding, almost healing, to be held by that circle of warmth. I 
                didn't tell anyone about what had happened, I just sat quietly, saying my thank-yous in my head.
              </p>
              <p>
                I never took to Chennai. The weather was harsh, the city never quite felt like home, and its energy 
                didn't sync with mine. My closest friends were in Bangalore and Hyderabad, so I'd grab any excuse to head 
                there. After that experience, I started making the trips more often — Friday night buses, Sunday night 
                returns, straight to the lab Monday morning. It wasn't efficient by any stretch, but it was an 
                optimization for the heart.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe it's okay to admit this at 25: my work defines me. Everything I am today has been built through it 
                and through the people I've met because of it. Over the last couple of years, I've cared for my work more 
                deeply than anything else. Sometimes too deeply.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few days after the wedding, I returned to campus. The first question someone asked me was, "Why were 
                you gone so long?" They didn't have the context to know why that question stung, but it stayed with me. 
                It set off a wave of reflection. What am I doing? What does my work really mean to me, or to anyone? Who 
                am I publishing these papers for? Am I happy doing this? Do I want to do this forever? So many questions, 
                all at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                By then, I had spent more than four years in the lab, working on different projects. I had always been 
                supported, guided on ideas, execution, and direction. But in my head, I'd set myself a challenge: before 
                finishing my PhD, I needed to take one idea from start to finish, entirely on my own. No hand-holding. If 
                I could pull that off and get it accepted into a conference, I'd be ready for the world. That time came 
                sooner than expected. I picked an idea, did the work, and after one retry, it got accepted. (I still had 
                people helping me along the way and honestly, fuck yes, there's no shame in that.) That was my quiet 
                victory proof that I could stand on my own.
              </p>
              <p>
                There was another big decision along the way. In mid-2023, when I was still fairly new to the field, I 
                had the chance to join Sarvam. But I passed. I wasn't ready yet. I needed to learn, to fail, to build 
                confidence in myself first. Two years later, that feeling changed. I called Rahul and said, <em>"I'm ready."</em> 
                (Dramatic for effect, but close enough.) And honestly, it's been nothing but fun since.
              </p>
              <p>
                My coping mechanism in life has always been adrenaline. When things get hard, my instinct is to chase 
                something that jolts me back, something that forces me to live entirely in that moment. I'm not sure if 
                it's healthy, but it works. It's the same feeling I get when I'm deep in my work, when everything clicks, 
                when hours disappear, when I'm knee-deep in thousands of lines of code and nothing else matters. I wish 
                more people could feel what I feel in those moments. (surprisingly, not many people feel that way and 
                that's okay. <em>You don't have to</em>. Everyone draws their own lines between work and life; I just 
                happen to blur mine more than most. I've also come to believe this: if you're spending 8–9 hours of your 
                waking day nearly a quarter of your life (45/24*7 = 26.7%) doing something, you might as well love it, or 
                at least learn to.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I know I have more work to do on the people front. I don't take that lightly. But for now, this is where 
                I am standing somewhere between gratitude and ambition, trying to live, work, and care a little more 
                every day.
              </p>

                <li>Saw snow for the first time - French Alps, March'25</li>
                <li>Bought a Ferrari Lego set in the airport duty free because impulse purchases are my thing. Now sits

                <li>Bought a bike I'd always wanted. Walked in, paid cash → little stupid in hindsight, could've made 
                some credit card points</li>
                <li>Jumped out of a plane (with a parachute, obviously) because my coping mechanism is vertical risk.</li>

                seconds.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>mild regrets</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Called friends and family more often — confession: my call frequency tanked in the second half of 
                the year. Sorry, people I love.
                  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                    <li>Rohit — yes, I will call you back. Consider this public promise</li>

                </li>
                <li>Stayed longer in Vienna left too soon and still dreaming of one more beer.</li>
                <li>Wanted to punch a guy in the face, resisted. Society won this round. (Barely)</li>
                <li>Committed more code to GitHub (I'm actually serious)</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                Grateful to be living a life that lets me do all this — the highs, the chaos, the Jäger, the code, and 
                everything in between.
